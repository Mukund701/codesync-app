CodeSync - Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor
Live Demo: https://codesync-app-five.vercel.app

CodeSync is a feature-rich, full-stack web application that allows multiple users to write and edit code together in real-time. It provides a seamless, low-latency collaborative experience with a suite of professional features, from live multi-cursor presence to sandboxed code execution.

Features
This project is packed with features designed to provide a complete and professional user experience.

üë• Real-Time Collaboration
Live Code Syncing: Code written by any user is instantly synchronized across all clients in the room.

Multi-User Cursors & Selections: See every user's cursor and text selections in real-time, complete with smooth animations.

Live User Presence: A real-time list displays all active users in the room, identified by their chosen display names.

Join/Leave Notifications: Receive toast notifications when users join or leave the room.

Synchronized Language Selection: The editor's language and syntax highlighting (JavaScript, Python, etc.) syncs in real-time for everyone.

üîê User & Account Management
Full User Authentication: Secure sign-up, login, and logout functionality powered by Firebase Authentication.

Protected Routes: Core application pages are protected, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

Customizable User Profiles: Users can set and update their display name from a dedicated Account Settings page.

Secure Password Change: Functionality for users to securely update their password.

Permanent Account Deletion: A secure, multi-step process for users to permanently delete their account.

üíæ Code & Room Management
Persistent Code Saving: All code and language settings for a room are automatically saved to a Firestore database.

Automatic State Loading: When returning to a room, the last saved version of the code is automatically loaded into the editor.

Unique Room Generation: A "Create a New Room" feature generates a unique, random ID and directs the user straight into the session.

üöÄ Code Execution
Multi-Language Runtime: Run code in multiple languages, including JavaScript (Node.js), Python, and Java.

Secure Sandboxed Execution: Code is executed securely via a backend API using the Judge0 sandbox, preventing malicious code from running on the server.

Resizable Output Panel: A rich output panel displays stdout, stderr, compile errors, and execution metadata like run time and memory usage.

‚ú® UI/UX Polishes
Professional Dark-Themed UI: Built with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and custom Geist fonts.

Custom App Icon: A programmatically generated SVG favicon for crisp branding.

Toast Notifications: Sonner is used for non-intrusive notifications for all major user actions.

Save Status Indicator: A live indicator in the editor header shows the current save state (Saving..., All changes saved).

Friendly Empty States: Welcoming messages are displayed when a user is the first to join a room.

Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm or yarn

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/Mukund701/codesync-app.git](https://github.com/Mukund701/codesync-app.git)
cd codesync-app

2. Setup Frontend
Navigate to the root directory.

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env.local file in the root and add the following environment variables.

# Your Socket.IO server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Firebase Project Keys (from your Firebase project console)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Judge0 API Key (from RapidAPI)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=

3. Setup Backend Server
Navigate to the server directory.

cd server

Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Run the Application
You need to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1 (Backend):

cd server
npm start

The server will be running on http://localhost:3001.

Terminal 2 (Frontend):

# From the root directory
npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

This project was built as a comprehensive showcase of full-stack development skills, focusing on real-time communication, modern UI/UX, and secure application architecture.
